# Repository for NOLA App
<h3> This app is called NOLA for Know Your Laws! </h3>
 <p>The purpose of the app is to help teenagers learn their US laws and rights
 to ensure that they become more educated citizens. It does this by presenting
 the dense rights information into bite-size summaries through the Right of
 the Day feature, as well as the game feature. Updates are coming!
